## Git
Git is a free, open-source, distributed version control system (VCS) designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It allows multiple developers to track and manage changes to source code over time. It is important for web development because it enables collaboration, allows developers to revert to previous states of their code, create branches to test new features without affecting the main codebase, and generally provides a safety net and a detailed history of a project's evolution. Platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket are built around Git.
